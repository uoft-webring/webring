# Your resume is obsolete.

<br />

Yes, **we said it.**

That PDF <span class="ghost">ghost</span>. That templated list.
It made you invisible.
Another line item in a sea of sameness.

But your work isn't a line item.
It's a story.
Your portfolio is your <span class="pulse-text">pulse</span>.

This is a rebellion.

## We are UofT Webring.

A network for the builders who dare to be different.
The coders who are also creators.

We’re not here to showcase your work.
We’re here to unleash your identity.

The future doesn’t belong to the cookie-cutter developer.
It belongs to the one who can’t be copied.

So, show them who you are.

Because when everyone is a brand,

**being yourself is the revolution.**
