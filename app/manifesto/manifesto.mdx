# Your resume is obsolete.

<br />

Yes, **we said it.**

That PDF <span className="ghost">ghost</span>. That templated list.
It made you invisible.
Another line item in a sea of sameness.

![(Insert your boring resume)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uoft-webring/webring/refs/heads/aman/manifesto/app/manifesto/resume.png)

But your work isn't a line item.
It's a story.
Your portfolio is your <span className="pulse-text">pulse</span>.

This is a rebellion.

We’re not here to showcase your work.
We’re here to unleash your identity.

The future doesn’t belong to the cookie-cutter developer.
It belongs to the one who can’t be copied.

So, show them who you are.

Because when everyone is a brand,

**being yourself is the revolution.**
